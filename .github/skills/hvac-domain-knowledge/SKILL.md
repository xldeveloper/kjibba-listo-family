# HVAC & Heat Pump Domain Knowledge (Norway)

This skill provides the domain context required to build and maintain the Digital Befaring system for Bergen Inneklima.

## Core Concepts

### Heat Pump Types
- **Luft-til-luft (Air-to-Air):** Most common. Distributes heat via indoor units.
- **Luft-til-vann (Air-to-Water):** Heats water for underfloor heating or radiators.
- **Væske-til-vann (Geothermal/Ground-source):** High efficiency, high installation cost.

### Efficiency Metrics
- **COP (Coefficient of Performance):** Instantaneous efficiency (e.g., 4.0 means 1kW electricity = 4kW heat).
- **SCOP (Seasonal COP):** Average efficiency over a full heating season.
- **SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio):** Efficiency for cooling.

## Technical Specifications (Survey Checklist)

When assisting with "Befaring" (Surveys), always consider:

### Installation Environment
| Field | Common Options | Note |
|-------|----------------|------|
| **Veggtype** | Gips, Mur, Betong, Tre | Essential for choosing correct drill/bolts |
| **Rørføring** | Synlig, Skjult | Aesthetic and cost impact |
| **Strømkurs** | Dedikert (10A/16A), Delt | Must follow Norwegian electrical code (NEK 400) |
| **Stige/Lift** | Nei, Ja (>2.5m) | Safety and equipment logistics |

### Outdoor Considerations
- **Vibration:** Need for "vibrasjonsdempere" (mounting dampers).
- **Drainage:** "Varmekabel i dryppanne" (heat cable in tray) for preventing ice buildup.
- **Clearance:** Minimum distance from corners/ground for optimal airflow.

## Norwegian Regulations

### F-gass Forordningen
- Only certified technicians can handle refrigerants.
- Logs must be kept for installations and leaks.

### Enova Subsidies
- Certain high-efficiency heat pumps (mostly liquid-to-water) qualify for national subsidies.

## Terminology (Norwegian/English)
- **Innerdel / Innedel:** Indoor Unit (IDU)
- **Utedel:** Outdoor Unit (ODU)
- **Kjølemedie:** Refrigerant (e.g., R32)
- **Varmekabel:** Heating cable
- **Fundament:** Foundation / Mounting base
- **Kanaler:** Trunking / Conduit for pipes
